# 💫About Me :

I am presently engaged in developing my own venture, [@Purple-Stock](https://github.com/Purple-Stock). My efforts are concentrated on creating open-source solutions tailored for the e-commerce, retail and industry sectors. The primary technologies I specialize in are Ruby on Rails, which form the core of my development stack.
